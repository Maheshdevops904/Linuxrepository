	2day 3 to 4 questions in this

RHEL 4,5,6
	1. BIOS (BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT system)
	2. MBR (Master boot recorder)
	3. GRUB (Grand unified boot loader)
	4. Kernel 
	5. Init (initilizing particular runlevel)
	6. Runlevel 
RHEL 7 & 8
	1. BIOS
	2. MBR
	3. GRUB
	4. Kernel
	5. Systemd

  BIOS :
	sub task 1: post(power on self test)
			post is a program which integrated in one of chip. it does health checkup of all the
			components which are connected to the mother board.
	sub task 2: cmos(complementory metal oxide semiconductor)
			cmos will capture and store the critical information before server goes down.
			the same information will be pass back to main memory while server coming up.
			critical informaiton : date and time, ram,processor info, startup program.
			
	sub task 3: find OS in devices and pass control to next stage
			ROM or bios
			read only memory
			ram random access memory
			
			dvd
			USB
			disk
			floppy
		as soon as bios finds the operating system in any of the componenent then bios pass control to 				MBR.

if not found operating system in any of the device then stages will not move further. it stops at BIOS stage.
		error : OS not found

	Stage 2 : MBR (Master boot recorder)
		
	MBR is a very small program, it stores in first sector of the operating system device.
	1 sec = 512 bytes
	446 bytes = primary boot loader information is nothing but next stage information. what is the next stage information that is grub.
	64 bytes = partition table information
	2  bytes = validator program.
if grub is in good condition then pass control to grub stage
if grub is not in good condition then mbr gives error like grub error.

stage 3: Grub (grand unfied boot loader) 
	RHEL 5,6  Grub
	RHEL 7,8  grub2

	grub is a just boot loader to boot default kernel or end user will have choice to boot required kernel.
	grub is a mediator to choose which kenel has to bootup at this time.

	if not select by default it boots with default kernel which we specified
	5 kernels
	end user can choose which kernel has to boot up. end user will have option to select kernel to boot up.

	rhel
	solari
	suse
	window
		7.0 3
		yum update
		7.5 2
		SuSE default
		grub2-set-default 3
		to boot with 7.0 operating system.
stage 4: kenel
	task1 : Load the drivers and modules
*		/boot/initramfs  .   it's a temp / file system. It contains configuration files to load drivers. it's equal to /.

		/boot/initrd

	task2 : Mount the / file system in read only mode
* in kernel stage / will be in which mode?
	read only th mode. 
*	if / is in read only mode then how next /sbin/init or /usr/lib/systemd/systemd programs will execute.
	read and execution is enough to execute pogram. write permissions doen't required to execute the program.
	task3 : trigger the following program /sbin/init(rhel5,6) /usr/lib/systemd/systemd(rhel7 & 8).
		/sbin/init rhel5 & 6. 
		/usr/lib/systemd/systemd rhel 7 & 8.
* the feature of systemd is it can load the startup programs parlely.
	pgr1 pgr2 pgr3
	
/sbin/init the startup programs will load in sequence order. one by one .

adv : reduced bootup time.

* what is the process id of /sbin/init or /usr/lib/systemd/systemd?
	1 is the process id of /sbin/init 
	1 is the process id of /usr/lib/systemd/systemd
* what is the first process of your operating system?
	/sbin/init if os is rhel 5 & 6
	/usr/lib/systemd/systemd if os is rhel 7 & 8.

rhel 6 : init
	how many runlevels are in rhel 6 ?
	7 run leves
	
     run level 0 shutdown
     run level 1 single user mode
     run level 2 command mode without nfs
     run level 3 command mode with nfs
     run level 4 R & D 
     run level 5 GUI( graphical user interface)
     run level 6 reboot

	init 6 reboot
	init 0 power off
	init 1 initilizing runlevel 1. switching one runlevel to other runlevel.


how many runlevels are in rhel 7 ?
  from rhel 7 onwards they introduced targets. instead of runlevels they given targets.
	target 1:poweroff.target
	target 2:rescue.target ( single user mode) it's for repair os related things.
	target 3:multi-user.target (runlevel 3)
	target 4: graphical.target( runlevel 5)
	target 5: reboot.target (runlevel 6)


stage 5: init (/etc/inittab) in line 26 here we will specify default runlevel.
	
	how to get present loaded runlevel
	rhel 6 : runlevel
		 who -r
	rhel 7 : systemctl get-default
		 runlevel
		 who -r
	/etc/inittab 26 line rhel 7 /etc/systemd/system/default.target


stage 6 : runlevels/ targets
	
	rc : run controller
	rc 0: runlevel 0
	rc0.d
	rc1.d
	rc2.d
	rc3.d
	rc4.d
	rc5.d
	rc6.d
	s startup program
	k kill program
	s80
	80 starting sequence number while booting up.


rhel 7 :  systemctl enable vsftpd   ==> vsftpd service should start in next boot
rhel 6 :  chkconfig vsftpd on
	  chkconfig --levle 35 vsftpd off

	  systemctl is-enabled vsftpd   ==> to get vsftpd service status in next boot
	  systemctl disable vsftpd      ==> disable vsftpd service in next boot. 

	imediately stop/start services
		systemctl start vsftpd   service vsftpd start
		systemctl stop vsftpd    service vsftpd stop
		systemctl restart vsftpd service vsftpd restart
		systemctl reload vsftpd  service vsftpd reload
