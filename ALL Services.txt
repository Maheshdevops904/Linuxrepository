if you start service even daemon will run.


   > FTP is for transfer files from one machine to other machine.
   Adv:
	1.  FTP is very fast,stable,efficient service.
	2.  we can transfer data through internet.
		we can access server through browser and command line
 Draw back:
	1. we can transfer only files not possible to transfer directories.
	2. FTP use the Binary format to transfer data over network.
		very easy hack data if data travelling in binary format, it's security bottleneck.

server side:
step1 : install vsftpd pkg in server machine
step2 : start the service
	systemctl start vsftpd
	systemctl enable vsftpd
please disable selinux
	setenforce 0
please stop firewall
	systemctl stop firewalld
	systemctl disable firewalld

client:
	ftp serverip


after connect
ls remote
!ls local ls
pwd remote
!pwd local
cd remote
lcd local

get is download
put is upload

get filename
put filename
mget file1 file2 file3
mput file5 file6 file7



1. Local users
2. anonymous user	

How to disable anonymous users?
	vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
		Actual = anonymous_enable=YES
		to     = anonymous_enable=NO
	restart service to reflect this parameter
	systemctl restart vsftpd

in browser : ftp://192.168.40.100
cmd : ftp 192.168.40.100

By default all the users are allowed except root user for FTP service.

how to provide ftp access to root user?
remove root user name in the /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers file
How to deny normal user?
add username in /etc/vsftpd/ftpsers file


useradd siva

how to deny all the users and allow specific users?
	vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
		userlist_enable=YES
		userlist_file=/etc/allowdftpusers
		userlist_deny=NO

	systemctl restart vsftpd


how to allow usres?
	add username in /etc/allowdftpusers
	prasad

how to change the anonimous users path
	vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
	add the below parameter
	anon_root=/opt/test

	chcon -R -t /var/ftp /opt/test 

two modes in FTP
	1. Active (windows machines)
	2. Passive (Unix machines)

	20: Data
	21: connection or command
active:
	client   and server
	client will initiate the connection on 21 port number
	1050 + 1
	1051 will decide by the client
	random port number will be decided by client machine. server has to do input rule.

passive :
client will initiate the connection on 21 port number
server will decide random number and request client allow it

	
	


			SSH (Secure shell)
	pkg = openssh
	service = sshd
	daemon= sshd
	port = 22
	configuration file : /etc/ssh/sshd_config

data will travel in encryption format.

Adv:
1. Data travel in secure manner with help of encryption mechanisum.
2. we can transfer files and directories through ssh service.
3. using ssh full administration can possible in remote machine.

	ssh 192.168.40.101
	ssh -l prasad 192.168.40.101
	ssh prasad@192.168.40.101

cp -r file /tmp/
i am in 100 machine and pushing /testdir directory to 101 machine.
scp -r /testdir prasad@192.168.40.101:/tmp/

we can pull from 101 machine
scp -r prasad@192.168.40.100:/tdir /home/prasad/


transferring /testdir directory data to 101 machine , it's copying by prasad user in /tmp path.


scenario 1:
 Disable root login through ssh service.

Unix team:15 every required root credentials are not?
	      yes

directly they will start login to server as a root
lvremove applv

	who deleted lv?
	  root


disable : ssh root@192.168.40.101 
accepted : ssh prasad@192.168.40.101
	   su - root
	in this case there will log in /var/log/secure file
	prasad opened session as a root

	tail -50 /var/log/secure


	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	# PermitRootLogin yes
	change it to 
	PermitRootLogin no
restart the sshd service to reflect the recent changes
	systemctl restart sshd

	

out of 15 users today 15 users logged in server but only 5 users switched to root.

How to change ssh port number?

22
Step 1 : change port number in configuration file.
	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	#Port 22
	change to 
	Port 2222
step 2: update the new port number in /etc/services file
	ssh             22/tcp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
	ssh             22/udp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol


change it to 
	ssh             2222/tcp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
	ssh             2222/udp                          # The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol

step 3 : restart the ssh service
	systemctl restar sshd


step 4 : disable the firewall
	 systemctl stop firewalld
	systemctl disable firewalld

How to deny normal users and groups through ssh service?

add below parameter in following file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	DenyUsers  prasad test
	DenyGroups groupname

	restart the sshd service to reflect above change
	systemctl restart sshd

eg : oracle will have common user that is oracle. 
	this oracle user is for start and stop the database in this every database administrator required oracle user password.


10 database servers
in all 10 machines there will be oracle user and it required all db administartors.


How to set Banner message for ssh login users?
step1:update banner file path in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		#Banner none
		change it to
		# Banner /etc/mybanner
step 2: create banner file	
create /etc/mybanner
	Welcome to server
step 3: restart the service
systemctl restart sshd


machine1                 machine2

username & password

creating trust relation between 2 machines.


machine1 [nfsserver]192.168.40.100
client [clientm1] 192.168.40.101
created user in both the machines
	useradd bkpuser

going to create trust relation from nfsserver to clientm1
 bkpuser can login from nfsserver to clientm1 without password.

nfsserver server user has to share public key with clientm1 then only client will trust and allow him without password.

    for each and every user will have 2 keys 1. Private 2. public.
	
s1 to s2
pub ==> in S2
s2 to s1
s2 pub ==> in S1

step 1: generate keys 
	ssh-keygen
note: make sure you logged in as bkpuser or respective user and generate keys.

step 2: share public key with clientm1 machine(192.168.40.101).
	ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub bkpuser@192.168.40.101
  please be in keys located place and execute above command.
	/home/bkpuser/.ssh/

	make sure 700 permissions on .ssh folder
	make sure 600 permissions on .ssh/authorized_keys file


Usecase:there is one script in clientm1 and it should trigger every day at 11:30 PM. 
	note: this script should be execute by nfsserver user.

usecase: clientm1 data needs to copy in nfsserver everyday at 11:40 PM.
  machine: nfsserver
		scp -r bkpuser@192.168.40.101:/data /bkp/clientm1/
 	
	40 23  * * * scp -r bkpuser@192.168.40.101:/data /bkp/clientm1/

by default 10 ssh connections can possible. how to increase ssh connections?
	/etc/ssh/sshd_config
	#MaxSessions 10
	change it to 
	MaxSessions 100
	systemctl restart sshd


		Difference between TCP/UDP
	1. TCP (data)
	2. UDP (data)
	3. ICMP (ping)


ftp in binary format ==> TCP
ssh ==> TCP
NTP ==> UDP
DNS ==> UDP

  TCP(Transmision control protocol)
  UDP(User datagram protocol)


 TCP								UDP
It's connection oriented protocol			It's connection less protocol

Header:								Sorce IP and port
source IP& port
Destination IP & port						destination ip & port
	sequence number
	acknowledgement number
	flag
	urgent pointer

Header size is 20 Bytes						8 Bytes
TCP is slow if we compare with UDP				Performance will be too good.
delivery							no gauranty
packet retry is possible					No retry facility
packets are very secure						no security for packets
it follows seq order						no seq order
error segments							no error segment


easy to hack
	ftp data (20/21) 20= data 21 = connection
	ssh data (22)
	nfs  data (2049)
	samba data (137,138,139)
	http data (80)
	rsync data (22)
	ntp date and time (123)
	dns hostname and IP (53)



			NFS
		Network File system

File system will be in network for access remote machines.

pkg: nfs-utils
port: 2049
service:nfs
Daemon:nfsd,mountd,nfslogd,lockd,statd
config file: /etc/nfsmount.conf

Versions : 2,3,4
current version is 4
RHEL 5 & 6 the default version was 3
RHEL 7 & 8 the default version is 4
		sshd
		vsftpd

nfsd:this is the main daemon of nfs, responsible to export file system and make sure applyning permissions. 
Mountd: responsible to take care mount requests from client machines.
nfslogd: it captures nfs clients and server related activities and write in /var/log/messages.
lockd:
statd:


	exporting file system in nfs server
	step 1 : make sure nfs-utils package is installed
	step 2 : identify the file system and grant full permissions to others
		eg: /sharedata
		chmod o+rwx /sharedata


	step 3 : export the file system
		vi /etc/exports
		/sharedata *(rw,sync)

	step 4 : start or restart the service
		systemctl restart nfs

		systemctl enable nfs
 disable firewalld
	systemctl stop firewalld
	systemctl disable firewalld

how to list out exported file systems in server
	exportfs


client machine:
	step 1 : make sure there is network between client machine and server
		ping 192.168.40.100
		telnet 192.168.40.100 2049
	note: move ahead with next steps if there is network and connection through 2049 port.
	step 2 : create local directory and mount network share.
		mkdir /sharedata
		mount 192.168.40.100:/sharedata /sharedata
	echo "192.168.40.100:/sharedata  /sharedata   nfs     defaults        0 0 " >> /etc/fstab

how to list out shared file systems/drives in remote machine?
	showmount -e 192.168.40.100 
	


	/sharedata *(rw,sync)   ==> everyone
 	/sharedata 192.168.40.*(rw,sync)  ==> only to 192.168.40. network
	/sharedata 192.168.*.*(rw,sync)  ==> granting access to all c class network
	/sharedata 192.168.40.103(rw,sync) ==> only to one machine
	/sharedata 192.168.40.104(ro,async)

* what is the difference between sync and async?
sync: writting data from client to server.
4 GB data
transferring from client to server
after successful copy data to server then server will give confirmation to client machine like data recieved.
sync is waiting to complete and give confirmation to client machine. 

async : async will confirm imediatly to client machine data recieved .
he will not wait until data copy. starting itself async will give confirmation to client.

* sync or async which one will improve the nfs perfomance?
	Async

	
-----------------------------------------------
5 things about nfs service
		=============================================
			1. pkg	= nfs-utils
			2. service = nfs-server
			3. daemon = nfsd,mountd,nfslogd,nfslockd,nfsstatd
			4. port = 2049
			5. configuration file  = /etc/nfs.conf   and /etc/nfsmount.conf

		exporting file system in nfs  server
	=====================================================
step 1 : install nfs-utils pkg in server where we want export the file system
	yum install nfs-utils


step 2 : create directory which one we want to export for client machines.
		mkdir /appdata
		chmod 777 /appdata
Step 3 : export the /appdata directory through nfs
		vi /etc/exports
			/appdata   *(rw,sync)
		
	just restart the nfs-server service to publish the export
		systemctl start nfs-server
		systemctl enable nfs-server
	stop the firewall
		systemctl stop firewalld
		systemctl disable firewalld

	mounting nfs file system in client side
	========================================
	make sure there is route between nfs client to nfs server
		ping nfsserverip
	also verify service is accesible or not
		telnet 192.168.1.10 2049
			or
		nc -vz 192.168.1.10 2049

both are looks good then access the nfs file system

	step 1 : verify which are the file systems are exported in nfs server side
			showmount -e nfs server ip
		showmount -e 192.168.1.10
	step 2 : mount the nfs file system
		mkdir /appdata
		mount 192.168.1.10:/appdata  /appdata
finally add entry in /etc/fstab
		device name         mountpointname       filesystemtype    permissions    bkp     fscheckup
	192.168.1.10:/appdata        /appdata              nfs              defaults       0      0

=================================================================================================================


export options
==============
/appdata  *(rw,sync)

directory  networklevelaccess(permissions,sync)
/appdata   192.168.1.12(rw,sync)   tell me as per this line for how many systems we granted access to /appdata? only 1(192.168.1.12)
/appdata   192.168.1.13(ro,sync)  same file system is exported and granted read only access only to 192.168.1.13 server
/appdata   192.168.1.14(ro,sync)  14 granted only read ony
/appdata  192.168.2.*(rw,sync) granted read and write access to entire 192.168.2.* systems(192.168.2.2 has access)
/appdata 192.168.*.*(rw,sync)   granted read and write permissions to private c class network

		what permissions 192.168.4.3  has on /appdata?
			can he mount this file system? yes
		what permissions 10.17.1.3  has on /appdata?
			 can he mount this file system? no

/appdata *(rw,sync)
			what permissions 10.17.1.3  has on /appdata?
			 can he mount this file system? yes






rw = read and write permissions on export for client machines.
ro = read only permissions on export for client machines.
***** difference between sync and async?

sync= nfs server will give confirmation to client machine once file completely copied to server. 
		client started coping 1 GB data to nfs file system and nfs server will give confirmation once after copy completly
			1 GB data to server side. 
		
async= nfs server will give confirmation to client machine once client start transferring data to nfs server.
		starting it self give the confirmation like data is recieved, async will not wait until data copy.
			
	which geniune? sync

	async is giving cofirmation as soon as client start copying. incase network is inturupted between nfs server to client but
		still client will have confident like my data is copied already based that message.

***** which option improves the nfs server performance?
    async

***** how to check nfs server version
	nfsstat -s | grep -i " Server nfs"
***** how to check nfs client version
	nfsstat -c | grep -i " Client nfs"

	what is the latest version?
		nfs version 4
		what is the old version? nfs v3


==================================================
*****	difference between NFS V3 and NFS V4
	====================================
		V3							      V4
============================================================================================================================
1.connection stateless:						1. Connection statefull:
	client will send request to server for data		client will send request to server for data and track the connection
	and just wait for response.				 and expect the response if not recieved response then it has inbuilt 
									feature to retry.
	but in stateless there will not be tracking.
2. it wont support ACL						2. It supports ACL
3. It wont support physical firewall , it mean via public	3. It can support physical firewall, can possible to access nfs file
	not possible to access the nfs file system			system via internet.

====================================================================================================================================
root_squash
no_root_squash
		
***** difference between root_squash and no_root_squash
we will include this option while exporting file systems, if we mention root_squash, then client root users are consider as nfs nobody, that means remote root users consider as a normal users. remote root users will not have rights on nfs file system. only nfs server root user is the owner.

if we go with no_root_squash then remote root users consider as a administrators, even remote machines root users will have full permissions on nfs file system.

	/data  *(rw,no_root_squash,sync) is the remote root users will have full permissions on /data file system? yes
	/data  *(rw,root_squash,sync) is hte remote root usrs will have full permissons on /data file system? no
		
which is the default option? root_squash

=====================================================================================================================
***** difference between soft mount and hard mount in nfs
=========================================================
	this soft and hard mount option is applicable for client machines, whoever is mounting the nfs file system.

mount -t nfs 192.168.1.10:/appdata /appdata -o soft
mount -t nfs 192.168.1.10:/appdata /appdata -o hard

vi /etc/fstab
	192.168.1.10:/appdata  /appdata  nfs   defaults,soft  0  0
	==========================================================

	if we include soft mount during mount then nfs client will reach 2 times with 2 min interval to nfs server incase any 
		connection inturuption.
	
	if we include hard mount during mount then nfs client will reach infinity or keep try for nfs server response incase any connection inturpted.

		soft = client will try for how many minites? 4 min first attempt 2 min , second attempt after 2 min.
					retrans=2 retries=2
		hard = client will try continuesly

which is the default? hard means lets client try for nfs server continuesly incase any inturuption.

=======================================================================================================================
	client machine
***** when we execute df -h we are seeting stale error for nfs file system, how you can fix it. what is the reason file system went into stale mode

stale = idle or inaccsible.

nfs stale error:
================
	100 or more than 100 clients will send mount request to nfs server.
	nfs server is responded to 99 requests somehow it could not able to respond to 1 client. this one client will go into stale mode

	how to rectify stale error?
		in client machine unmount the stale nfs file system and remount
		
		step 1 : umount -l /appdata
		step 2 : mount -t nfs 192.168.1.10:/appdata /appdata -o soft

How to identify right now how many clients are connected to nfs server?
	login to server and find out established connections
		ss -nap | grep :2049 | grep -i "estab" |wc -l
			or
		netstat -nap | grep :2049 | grep -i "estab" |wc -l

nfs is common for all unix Operating systems.
	exported in solaris and client machine is rhel, will it work? yes


	chmod 775 /appdata
	vi /etc/exprots
		/appdata  192.168.1.12(ro,sync,no_root_squash)
		/appdata  192.168.1.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

	other machine
		su - prasad
		
	
==========================================================================================================================
			automount
================================================================

nfs mount(permanent mount)								automount
=============================================================================================================			
1.File system will be mounted permanently           1. file system will mount whenever we try to go inside that directory, also it 							unmount after 5 min once we comeout from that directory


	advantages of mount and unmount automatically

		1. we can save the network bandwidth between nfs client machine to nfs server, because file system in not mounting
			permanently.
		2. it can improve nfs server performance
	
	is this part of nfs client mount? yes

	autofs use any seperate file system? no it use the nfs only. we are going to schedule mount and unmount automatically.




	nfs client:
	===============
	pre-requisite
		make sure autofs package is installed
			pkg : autofs
			service : autofs
			daemon : autofs
			configuration file : /etc/autofs.conf


	

step 1 : open the auto.master file and allow / file system to support the autofs
		vi /etc/auto.master
			at end the end add below line
					/-  auto.misc
step 2 : add the nfs mount details in auto.misc file
			/appd      -fstype=nfs      192.168.1.10:/appdata


	come out and create /appd directory
			mkdir /appd

step 3 : restart the autofs service
		
==============================================
***** df -h command output is getting struck, how you can fix it? what may be the problem?

	ans:  may be one of nfs file system not mounting so df -h is getting struck

we have to find out which nfs file system have difficulty to mount and fix issue at nfs server end.

	login nfs server and verify below things
		posibility 1 : may be nfs server is down
				if server is down then start it
		possibility 2 : nfs server service is down
				login to nfs server and start the nfs service
						systemctl start nfs-server
		possibility 3 : may firewalld is blocking
				allow 2049 port in firewall or stop the firewall
				systemctl stop firewalld

	nfs service is not starting up? what may be the reason?
		i am trying to start the nfs service but it is not coming up
			may be mistakes in /etc/exports
			
				/appdata*(rw,sync)
	the above entry is wrong
				correct entry is   /appdata   *(rw,sync)
			
			another linux admin exporting one more file system 
					/appdata2  *(rwx,syn)

	it is a wrong entry, so it will effect to /appdata or not?


***** what is nfs and how you can export and mount it in client machine
nfs is nothing but network file system, we can export file system in network and clients can mount based on their access.
we have to install nfs-utils package in nfs server where we want to export the file system
once after install we can find /etc/exports file here we can add the file sytem details to export like
	/appdata   *(rw,sync)
then we can restart the nfs-server service
		systemctl restart nfs-server

then we have to go to client machine and mount this nfs file system
	first we have to check route between client machine to nfs server
			ping nfsserverip
	also we have to verify 2049 port is connecting or not
			telnet nfserverip  2049
	if connecting then good to mount

	create one local directory
		eg : mkdir /appdata
then mount
	mount nfsserverip:/appdata  /appdata 
also add entry in /etc/fstab file

--------------------------------------------------


nfs: Unix to unix
we can share file system between Unix platform to unix platform.

unix to windows
unix to unix

		SAMBA

the unique future of samba is we can export file system across cross platforms(unix to windows and windows to Unix)
		Pkg: Samba and cifs-utils
		ports : Unix 137,138,139  ( Unix to windows)
			windows : 445 ( windows to Unix)
		service : smb
		daemon : smbd
		config file : /etc/samba/smb.conf


Scenario 1 : export file system in windows and accessing it in Linux box.

	exportfs 
to know the exported file system in windows
	\\localhost
how to know the IP address in windows?
	ipconfig /all


step 1 : share the file system in windows
	rc on directory and share with ==> specific people
step 2 : login to Linux box and do the connectivity test.
	  ping windowsIP
	  telnet windowsIP 445
step 3 : create Local directory and mount windows file system with local directory.
		mkdir /soft
		mount.cifs //192.168.40.1/Softwares /soft -o username=test,password=test123
	vi /etc/fstab
		
		//192.168.40.1/Softwares   /soft  cifs  defaults,username=test,password=test123  0 0
	
Hidding credentials
	vi /root/.cre
	username=test
	password=test123
chmod 600 /root/.cre
mount.cifs //192.168.40.1/Softwares /soft -o credentials=/root/.cre	
in fstab
//192.168.40.1/Softwares   /soft  cifs  defaults,credentials=/root/.cre  0 0



Scenario 2 : export file system in Linux and access it in Windows box?

step 1 : make sure samba and cifs-utils pakcages are installed
	  yum install samba cifs-utils


step 2 : Decide which file system we are going export and make sure other have full permissions on it
		mkdir /winshare
		chmod o+rwx /winshare
step 3 : export it
	vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
	
[prasadshare]
path = /winshare
browseable = yes
writable = yes
write list = prasad


save and come out and then validate the syntax mistakes
	testparm

integrating linux machine with AD(active directory)
SSSD   this one
Samba


---------------------------------------------------------------------------			

	NTP
			Network time protocol

NTP service is for supply date and time to client machines. 
sessions will get expair if we maintain stand alone date and time to individual machine because development team sets the session expairy and time out for sessions.

must and should we have to maintain seperate NTP server and make sure all clients are integrated with NTP server to sync up latest date & time.


Task 1 : configure NTP server
	pkg : ntp
	service : ntpd
	daemon  : ntpd
	port    : 123/UDP
	config file : /etc/ntp.conf

step 1 : install latest ntp package
step 2 : customize ntp settings
	vi /etc/ntp.conf
	# Hosts on local network are less restricted.
change 1:	restrict 192.168.40.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap
change 2: 	server 127.127.1.0
		fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 2
step 3 : start the ntp service
	systemctl restart ntpd
	systemctl enable ntpd
note: make sure firewalld service is stopped
validate is ntp is working.
ntpq -np





client side:

step 1 : install latest ntp package
step 2 : customize configuration file
	remove existng server lines and add our internal server ip
		server 192.168.40.100 prefer

step 3 : restart ntpd service
	systemctl restart ntpd
	systemctl enable ntpd

ntpq -np



offset is actual round trip difference between ntp server and client


chrony:
introduced from RHEL 7 onwards. it can recovery offset value automatically between client to ntp server.
pkg : chrony
service : chronyd
daemon: chronyd
port : 123/udp
config file: /etc/chrony.conf


to get the ntp status
chronyc tracking  = ntpstat 
how to get ntp server details?
chronyc sources
how to get latest date and time from the ntp server manually?
chronyd -q "192.168.40.100"


				DNS 
			Domain name system


ftp = Transfer data
ssh = Transfer data and remote machine administration
nfs = Transfer data
samba = Transfer data across cross platforms
ntp  = date and time will transfer over the service

DNS: It resolves name to IP address.
as well it resolves IP to name

  network will understand only IP format.

   ssh 192.168.40.100
   ssh machine2


google.com  
facebook.com ==> 12.1.2.100 
amazon.com   ==> 11.1.2.100

      	pkg : bind, bind-utils
	service : named
	daemon  : named
	port    : 53/UDP
	configuration file : /etc/named.conf
along with configuration file we will maintain 2 more files
1. forward lookup zone : here we will update name to IP address details. /var/named/
2. Reverse lookup zone : here we will maintain IP to name details. /var/named/


1. Global DNS server
2. Internal DNS server

       1. GTLD
       2. CCTLD
	GTLD(General Top level domains) 21
	.com
	.org
	.corp
	.info
	.edu
	.gov
CCTLD ( Contry code top level domains)
	.in
	.pk
	.sk
	.nl
	.us
	.uk
	.nl



	DNS     server is reuqired to maintain all clients or web site name and IP details
	Local DNS  here dedicated DNS server doen't required. we will maintain entries in /etc/hosts file

    1000 machines.
1000 * 1000

999 = 1000
998 = 1000
   dns 1000

10 = no need dns server recommneded is local entries


   forward lookup zone file : /var/named/fwdprasad.com
   reverse lookup zone file : /var/named/revprasad.com



       DNS records types
	1. SOA   (start of authority)        f/r
	2. NS    ( Name server)              f/r
	3. MX    ( Mail exchange server)     f/r
	4. A     ( Address record for IPV4)  F
	5. AAAA  ( Address record for IPV6)  F
	6. PTR   ( Pointer)                  R   
	7. CNAME ( conanical name or alias name) F
	  eg: www.facebook	IN	A	10.31.2.1
		fb		IN	CNAME	www.facebook


 CNAME
  A
  NS


* what is TTL?

newly added records will get activated after expairing TTL time.
eg: 17-11-2020 at 7:20 AM one new record has been added into forward lookup zone, suppose TTL time is 1 Day then this newly added record will activate after 24 hours. 
  it will get activated at 18-11-2020 at 7:20 AM onwards.

to reflect newly added records imediatly.
    systemctl restart named
      or
    decrease TTL time  and restart named service to reflect this ttl time.
	systemctl restart named


  primary DNS server or master DNS server

  Slave DNS sever

SOA :  here we will maintain master dns server resources and slave replication details.




domain name : b22.com
server name : nfsserver
FQDN : nfsserver.b22.com.
fully qualified domain name

  
refresh: between DNS master server to slave server if slave is there.
retry : 6 AM retry has happened, next retry will happen at 8 AM but failed at 8 AM.

test.b22.com
t.b22.com

note: make sure we have assigned static IP for DNS server


step 1 : create forward lookup zone and update entries 
$TTL 600
@       IN SOA  nfsserver.b22.com. root.b22.com. (
                                2020111702      ; serial
                                        2h    ; refresh
                                        1h    ; retry
                                        2d  ; expire
                                        1d   ; minimum
)
@               IN      NS      nfsserver.b22.com.
@               IN      A       192.168.40.100
nfsserver       IN      A       192.168.40.100
clientm1       IN      A       192.168.40.101
clientm2       IN      A       192.168.40.102
clientm3       IN      A       192.168.40.103
www.prasad      IN      CNAME   nfsserver
clientm4        IN      A       192.168.40.104
step 2: create main configuration file
	vi /etc/named.conf
options
{
        directory               "/var/named";           // "Working" directory
        dump-file               "data/cache_dump.db";
        statistics-file         "data/named_stats.txt";
        memstatistics-file      "data/named_mem_stats.txt";

        listen-on port 53       { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.40.100; };
allow-query     { localhost; 192.168.40.0/24; };

};

        zone "b22.com" IN {
                type master;
                allow-query     {any; };
                file "fwdb22";
        };

step 3 : verify syntax of config file and zone file
	configuration file : named-checkconf /etc/named.conf
	zone file : named-checkzone b22.com /var/named/fwdb22

step 4 : restart the named service to reflect new dns server.
	systemctl restart named
	systemctl enable named
 note : make sure firewall is disabled




how to integrate client machine with DNS server?
 in client machine just update dns server details in /etc/resolv.conf file
	search b22.com
	nameserver 192.168.40.100




* how to find out your dns server details?
nslookup 
>server

  

				HTTP

www.facebook.com
http://facebook.com
			Hyper text transfer protocol
http service will serve the web pages.
http can transfer the hyper text that is your html design.

ftp,ssh,nfs,samba
ntp = date and time synch
dns = resolves the name to IP and IP address to name
http: transfer data

		pkg: httpd
		port : 80
		service : httpd
		daemon : httpd
		config file : /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
		default web pages location is : /var/www/html/

	types of web hosting
	1. Virtual hosting
	2. Name based hosting
	3. Port based hosting
virtual hosting is nothing but one ip one web page
named based hosting : one ip n number web pages with different name
			www.web1.b22.com
			www.web2.b22.com
			www.web3.b22.com
			www.web4.b22.com
	all of the web pages we will get from single server
port based hosting : single ip but n number web pages with different port numbers
			www.web1.b22.com:8080
			www.web1.b22.com:8089
			www.web1.b22.com:9090


make sure httpd package is installed ( yum install httpd)
step 1 : copy the web page in /var/www/html
	  mkdir /var/www/html/web1
	 copied my webpage content to /var/www/html/web1
	cp -r /root/frozenyogurtshop/* /var/www/html/web1/
step 2 : remove default webpage
		mv /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf /etc/httpd/
step 3 : add below line in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	IncludeOptional webpages/*.conf
Step 4 : create directory and create webpage
	mkdir -p /etc/httpd/webpages
	cd /etcd/httpd/webpages
	 vi web1.conf
<VirtualHost 192.168.40.101:80>
ServerName www.site1.b22.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/web1
ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/web1.error.log
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/web1.requests.log combined
</VirtualHost>

step 5: validate the syntax errors, if no errors then start httpd service
	apachectl configtest
        systemctl restart httpd
	systemctl enable httpd
    in case firewall is running, please stop the firewall
	systemctl stop firewalld

step 6 : update new webpage name details in forward lookup zone file in dns server.
	vi /var/named/fwdb22
	www.site1    IN  A  192.168.40.101





2. name based web hosting 

step 1 : copy the web page in /var/www/html
	  mkdir /var/www/html/site2
	 copied my webpage content to /var/www/html/site2
	
step 2: configure the webpage
	cd /etc/httpd/webpages
         vi mywebsites.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName www.site2.b22.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site2
ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/site2.error.log
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/site2.requests.log combined
</VirtualHost>

restart httpd service
systemctl restart httpd

step 3 : update DNS entries in forward lookup zone


3. port based hosting

step 1 : copy the web page in /var/www/html
	  mkdir /var/www/html/site4
	 copied my webpage content to /var/www/html/site4
	
step 2: configure the webpage
	cd /etc/httpd/webpages
         vi mywebsites.conf
<VirtualHost *:8080>
ServerName www.site4.b22.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site4
ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/site4.error.log
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/site4.requests.log combined
</VirtualHost>

step 3 : updte new port in config file
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	Listen 8080

restart httpd service
systemctl restart httpd

step 4 : update DNS entries in forward lookup zone

in browser
www.site4.b22.com:8080



httpd related logs will store in /var/log/httpd
