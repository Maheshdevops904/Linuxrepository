Hardware requirement for RHEL 7

RAM = 2 GB
Disk = 6 GB
processor = any



      			/

/ is a parent directory
 inside this parent directory we will have 13 default important directories.

   1. /boot
   2. /root
   3. /home
   4. /etc
   5. /var
   6. /usr
   7. /sbin(/usr/sbin)
   8. /bin(/usr/bin)
   9. /lib
   10. /proc
   11. /dev
   12. /mnt
   13. /tmp


1. /boot : contains the OS bootable files, these files helps to load your operating system.(eg: kernel files).


 clear = to clear the screen (ctl+l)

alt+F2

2. /root : it's a home directory of administrator.who is the administrator in Linux/Unix root user.
        no other user can enter into root user home directory.
       
   window: c:/users/admin
			Desktop,Downloads, Documents.....

	   c:/users/prasad
			Desktop,Downloads,Documents......
3. /home  :  contains other users home directories. this is the default location for other users.

4. /etc  : it contains configuration files of operating system and third party tools/softwares configuration files.
5. /var  :  it contains activity report or log(activity report) of system activities.
   /var/log i deleted everything from /var/log . is operating sytem will come up? yes
     unfortunatly deleted /boot directory data. is operating system will cme up? no
6. /usr;  Unix system resources
      it contains oprerating system binaries(programs) like commands(ls,cd,cp,rm,useradd,userdel)

  ls  command
  cd  command
  pwd command
  rm   command
                 /usr/bin ( common commands for all users commands)
                 /usr/sbin (super(root) user commands)

		useraddministration commands : sbin
    		 useradd,userdel,usermod

		software managment:   sbin
		install,uninstall,upgrade

		ls,cd,pwd    =  bin



7.  /bin  : few commands are seperated from /usr/bin to /bin location. these commands will help during OS boot up.
8.  /sbin : few commands are seperated from /usr/sbin to /sbin directory or location. these commands will help during os boot up.
9.  /lib  : it contains libraries of operating system. these libraries(programs) are shared between multiple commands or binraries.
   libraries are important to run your programs or operating system.
     /boot = important to load operating system
     /lib  = imp to load operating system
10. /proc  :  it a temp directory for processor. this directory used by processor(cpu). it stores data of process or task.
11. /dev  :  It contains logical device names( cd/DVD, hard disk, RAM,).
12. /mnt   : guest directory . we can store any data here
13. /tmp  : it contains every user running processes data. 



                         File Management
			=================
			
	1. Cat (Concatenate)
	2. VI  (Virtual interface)
	3. Touch

windows: Notepad and ms word

  files will be in black colour
  directories will be in blue

      cat > filename
	ctrl + d
==> to view the file content
	
cat filename 
==> to view the file content with line numbers
	cat -n filename


==> how to append content to existing file
	cat >> batch22

the limitation in cat is we can't modify existing data.
> create and overwrite  if file is not exists then it creates. If file is exists then it overwrites.
>> append

VI virtual interface

1. Command mode(default mode)
2. Insert mode
3. Replacement mode

5yy: to copy 5 lines from the cursor standing line. 
p  : to past copied data below cursor postion. small p
shift + p : to past copied data above of cursor postion. capital P.
cc : to cut the cursor postion line
10cc : to cut 10 from the cursor position line.

how to switch from command mode to insert mode ==> i
how to switch back to command mode ==> esc we have presess esc key to come back command mode

:se nu : to set the line numbers for the file content
:se nonu : to unapear/hide line numbers for the file content.
gg   : to take cursor to file line of the file.
Shift + g : to take cursor to last line of the file. shift + g is nothing capital G
:25 : to take cursor to particular line of file
:15

i : to switch into the insert mode at the same position of cursor.
a : switch into the insert mode but next position of cursor standing.
o : create new below of cursor position line and switch to insert mode.
shift + O : create new line above of cursor position line and switch into insert mode.

:w : save the changes
:q : quit from the file without save changes
:wq : is for save changes and quit from the file.
$   : to take cursor to end of the line
0(zero)  : to take cursor to starting of the line
   
Shift + i I    : Take cursor to starting of the line and switch into insert mode
shift + a A    : Take cursor to end of the line and swith into insert mode
i 
a

Search options
/word
?word
/prasad   : search string from cursor position to down 
		n is for seach string next location or position.
		N is go back to previous search

?prasad   : search string froom cursor position to up
		n is for go back to previous search place
		N is for search string in the next position

Replace:
:%s/prasad/prasad babu/g
:%s/existingword/newword/g


x   : is for delete single char from cursor position
dw  : is for delete one word from the cursor position

r  : is for replace one char from the cursor position.
Shift + r R  : is for switch from command mode to replacement mode
esc  is for come back to command mode

< h : is for move cursor to left from cursor standing position.
> l : is for move cursor to right from cursor standing poistion.
 k : is for move cursor to up
 j : is for move cursor to down
    

   Touch:

it is for update curent date and time of existing file
 touch is for create empty files this is wrong. the actual functionality is change current timestamp to the existing file.

touch file2 file3 file4 file5 file6 file7
if file is not exist then touch creates empty file. if file is exist then just update curent date & time to file.

field 1 : file type
  - = regular file
  d = directory
  l = linked file or shortcut file from different place
  b = block device files which can understand end user
  c = chart device files which can understand OS
  p = Pip (OS purpose)
  S = Socket( OS purpose)

Field 2: Permissions

     GREP
    -----

grep is for search string/word from file or files in one depth of directory.

to search file or directory is exist or not there we will use find command not grep.

1. Grep : To search string in file
2. find : to search file or directory in system.


      grep <word> file name
      grep <word> *
      grep -w prasad batch22
      grep -wc prasad batch22
 	grep -wn prasad batch22
	grep -l prasad *
	grep -A 5 prasad /logfile



w = word search
c = count how many times it exist file
n = print the line numbers where and all finds the word
l = list out the filename where and all string exists. it can look only one depth of directory
A = print 5 lines after string found
B = print 5 lines before string found

how to search multiple strings
   grep -w "word1\|word2\|word3\|word4" /filename


 

Linux: Redhat(RHEL),CENTOS,Fedora,SuSE,ubuntu,pupy linux,kaly linux

OS = is nothing collection programs, with help of these programs only we are able to intaract with hardware.
os is nothing interpreter between end user and hardware.

Unix OS released in 1969. It's purly C based operating system. operating system developed in C language.
 

unix is a open source operating system.

code is open to modify 

linux is purly open sorce operating system.

  RHEL (red hat enterprise linux)
  RHEL 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

 60-70 machines are running with RHEL 7
  25 %  machines are running with RHEL 6
   5 %  machines  are running with RHEL 8

 
 RHEL 7 is the major version
   7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10


major 7
minor 7.1,7.2.....


          root is the default administrator in Linux servers

    /


        pwd : print working directory

        cd /   : change directory
 	ls  : list out the current folder data.




		Disk Management


		Disk Architecture

	Disk management methods
	1. Basic Method
	2. LVM Method (Logical Volume management)
	3. Raid(MDADM)

 
01011001 = 8 Bits

8 Bits  	= 1 Byte
1024 Bytes 	= 1 KB (Kilobyte)
1024 KB		= 1 MB (Megabyte)
1024 MB		= 1 GB (gigabyte)
1024 GB		= 1 TB(Terabyte)
1024 TB		= 1 PB(Petabyte)
1024 PB		= 1 EB(Exa byte)

1 sector = 512 bytes
2 sectors = 1 KB

 HDD(IDE method) = Integrated Device electronics (16 partitions) /dev/hda

 scsi = small computer system interface (64 Partitions)   /dev/sda  
		scsi disk or sata disk

		/dev/sda
			a is first disk
			b is second disk
		/dev/sdb
		/dev/sdc
		/dev/sdd1 (1 partition)
		/dev/sdd2 (2nd partition)
		/dev/sdd3 (3rd partition)
		/dev/sdd4 (4th partition)

                /dev/sdd64


      
  	there are 2 types of partitions
	1. Primary partition 
	2. Logical partition

primary supports to store bootable files.Like opearting system realated files
logical is for store general data.
*  in each scsi disk we can create max 4 primary partitions.
	/boot is a primary partition
	/, /var and any other partitions are logical partitions

how to scan for new disk
  echo " - - - " >> /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan
  echo " - - - " >> /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/scan
  echo " - - - " >> /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/scan

Create partition using normal method.
step 1: Create the partition ( enter inside disk and create partition) fdisk /dev/sdb  n ==> p ==> partition number 1 ==> starting sector default just enter ==> ending sectory +2G and enter
	p : print the partition table information
	n : create new partition
	d : delete partition
	m : help
	t : change partition system id ( 83 linux, 82 swap , 8e lvm)


			/dev/sdb
			/dv/sdb1    p
			/dev/sdb2   extended
			/dev/sdb3   logical
			/dev/sdb4   logical
			/dev/sdb5   logical

step 2:  update disk changes to kernel using partprobe command : partprobe /dev/sdb
step 3:  keep partition in any of the file system type (ext2,ext3,ext4,xfs)   mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
										mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2
		ext2 : RHEL 4
		ext3 : RHEL 5
		ext4 : RHEL 6
		xfs  : RHEL 7 & 8

* explain difference between ext4 and xfs 
* what is journaling?
	journaling is nothing but data about data is nothing but meta data. 

		journaling will mantain data about data like how many sectors are allocated for one file and sectors 
			numbers will be written in meta data.

    benifit: faster repair/recovery in case file system corrupted.


step 4:Create one directory and mount the partition to that directory . mkdir /data  mount /dev/sdb1 /data
step 5: add new file system details in /etc/fstab file to make permanent mount.

   there are 7 Fields in /etc/fstab


/dev/sdb1     /data      xfs    defaults  0  1
/dev/sdc1     /test      xfs    defaults,noauto  0  2
/dev/sdc5     /oracle      xfs    defaults,noauto  0  2



Devicename	Mountpoint	Filesystem-type	Permissions	Backup-partition	Filesystem-checkup-during-bootup
1		2		3		4		5			6	


backup 0 = No meta data backup
       1 = Backup meta data
for OS partitions we can recomend 1.

/     = OS
/boot = OS
/test = other partition
/oradata = Other partitions
file system checkup
  	0 No file system checkup during boot up.  no repair on file system during server coming up.
	1 : serial file system checkup and first priority file systems.
	2 : parlel or second priority


* explain about fstab fields
  6 fields
